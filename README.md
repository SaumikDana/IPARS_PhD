IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator) is a cutting-edge framework designed for petroleum reservoir simulation. Developed as part of the ACTI project, IPARS serves as a platform for testing multiphase flow models, numerical discretizations, solvers, and upscaling techniques.

The framework boasts a wide range of features, including compatibility with various platforms, advanced memory management for complex geometries and grids, time step control, error management, and CPU timing system. It also provides visualization outputs for scalar and vector variables, data tables, and more.

IPARS supports a variety of physical models, such as two-phase (oil/water) implicit, black oil (three phase, three component), and single phase (slightly compressible) explicit models. The system has demonstrated its capabilities by successfully running large-scale problems and achieving multiphysics coupling, where different IPARS models are interconnected.

In summary, IPARS is a comprehensive and versatile tool for petroleum reservoir simulation, offering a robust platform for testing and implementing advanced models and techniques in reservoir engineering.
